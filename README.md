## Introduction

The BCR Calculator Application is designed to assist engineers and project managers in evaluating the economic feasibility of bridge-related projects. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface for entering project data, calculating maintenance costs, and estimating the BCR, a critical metric for decision-making in infrastructure projects.

## Key Features

### 1. Tab-Based User Interface

The application features a tab-based user interface that organizes information and calculations into distinct sections, making it easy to navigate and manage project data.

- **Homepage**: Provides an overview and serves as the main entry point.
- **Deck, Steel, SubStructure, and SuperStructure Tabs**: Allows for detailed data entry and cost calculations for different project components.
- **Final Result**: Displays the final project cost and BCR calculation results.

### 2. Database Integration

The application integrates with a database for storing and retrieving project-specific data. This ensures data consistency and facilitates historical data analysis.

### 3. Comprehensive Data Entry

- Enter bridge-specific data, such as bridge ID, UUID, ADT (Average Daily Traffic), Detour Length (mi), and ADT_TRk.
- Input costs for various project elements, including deck, steel, substructure, and superstructure.
- Calculate maintenance costs and BCR based on user inputs.

### 4. Error Handling

The application includes error-handling mechanisms to ensure that mandatory data fields are provided before performing calculations. Users receive informative error messages when essential data is missing.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the BCR Calculator Application:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   https://github.com/AvinashMahala/BenefitCostRatioCalc.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Database Configuration**: Ensure that your database configuration is set correctly. Modify the database connection details as needed in the application.

4. **Run the Application**: Start the application by running the `main.py` script:

   ```shell
   python main.py
   ```

   This will launch the BCR Calculator Application.

## Using the Application

### Data Entry

1. **Homepage**: Enter the bridge ID and UUID to access project-specific data.

2. **Deck, Steel, SubStructure, and SuperStructure Tabs**: Input costs and project data for different bridge elements.

3. **Final Result**: View the final project cost and BCR calculation results.

### Error Handling

- The application will display error messages if mandatory data fields are missing or if there are issues with data input.

### Database Integration

- The application integrates with a database for data storage and retrieval. Ensure that your database is correctly configured and accessible.

## Technical Details

The BCR Calculator Application is built using the following technologies:

- **Python**: The core programming language used for development.
- **Tkinter**: A Python library for building graphical user interfaces (GUI).
- **SQLite**: A lightweight, built-in database used for data storage and retrieval.
